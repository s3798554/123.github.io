                    <p>
                         I am  ZHEN YANG,a Chinese boy  who is 20 years old now.This is my first semester of bachelor of information technology.Actually,I completed English training at REW from August to December last year.My nick name is Melo, probably some people are familiar with this name,that's because I used the name of one of my idols. He is a famous NBA star named Carmelo Anthony,people like to call him Melo. Basketball is one of my favorite sports, I have started to watch NBA games since 12 years old.I am interested in almost all mainstream sports but most of them are just limited to watching games.Even if I don not participate in some sports in reality,however,the excitement of sports games still attract me deeply.

                    <h2 class="major">Interest In IT</h2>
                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>①What's your interest in IT?When did your interest in IT start?Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?Outline your IT experience(if any).</p>
                    <p>  So far I am more interested in security in IT. In fact, I do not know much about the IT field, but security is an absolutely indispensable part of the IT industry. Although the security in IT is complex and difficult like the encryption and decryption of various instructions, the principles are worthy of research.
                        I think my interest in security in IT started in junior high and high school. At that time, I watched a lot of movies about secret agents and spy warfare.In those movies,there are lots of computer masters who use computers to easily obtain enemy information and destroy them.To be honest, they look very cool and give me a shock about the security in IT.
                        Honestly,so far I have no IT experience because I just study in university.Probably the only one experience is I have design a mini application as final exam when I studied in China's university.</p>
                    <p>②Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</p>
                    <p>  In fact, the university I studied in China has cooperation with RMIT. I have studied IT courses for two years in a Chinese university. After passing the assessment, I went to RMIT to continue my two-year undergraduate IT study. Then I can get a double degree.However, the university I studied in China also cooperates with universities in other countries, but I think RMIT will be the best choice in terms of academic level and school life.In addition,the high employment rate of RMIT graduates is also very attractive to me.</p>
                    <p>③What do you expect to learn during your studies?</p>
                    <p>  I want to gain more specific knowledge about IT in my RMIT study, not just some theoretical content, but more practical operation and application in reality.I expect that what I have learned will be of great help to my future work which is practical.Moreover,I want to learn more about code and exercise my programming skills during my studies in RMIT.</p>

                    <p>  I think that for this position is to provide IT services to financial companies, especially for maintaining the company's website and responsible for the security of the website. And to provide IT technical support to customers and service providers.What attracts me most about this position is that it is in a financial company. I hope that my job can be integrated with the financial industry.In addition,this job may allow me to have more choices about where to work and I am satisfied with its salary.
                        For this position, at least 3 years of relevant IT work experience is required because it has a higher income. For the technical side, it requires employees to have sufficient web technologies and sufficient basic IT skills. What's more, employees need to have good communication skills when they face customers.
                        So far for me, I don't have much skills in web programming and maintenance, and some basic IT skills are not well mastered. But I want to be very friendly and patient when facing others.
                        I am still studying for my undergraduate IT degree, and I hope to exercise my basic IT skills and learn more about information security and programming. After that, I plan to apply for a master's degree in IT to improve my IT skills more precisely. I hope I can get some job opportunities after graduation to ensure that I can accumulate a lot of experience for my ideal job.</p>

                    <p>The result of MBTI test:</p>
                    <p>Talent analysis: your personality type tendency is " ESFP " (extroverted real feeling perception  tendency: E57, S58, F61, P74, thoughtless index: 11)

                        Outgoing, friendly and tolerant. Love life, humanity and material enjoyment. Like to work with others. In the work, pay attention to common sense and practicality, pay attention to the actual situation, and make the work interesting. Flexible and impromptu, naturally not artificial, easy to accept new friends and adapt to new environments. Learning new skills with others can achieve the best learning results.</p>
                    <p>The result of Learning style test:</p>
                    <p>1.Visual is your primary learning style.</p>
                    <p>2.Auditory is your secondary learning style.</p>
                    <p>3.Kinesthetic is your least preferred learning style.</p>
                    <p>The result of Big Five Personality test:</p>
                    <p>O:48%  C:56% E:60% A:67% N:29%</p> 
                    <p>①For the results of the MBTI test, it shows that I am a friendly, outgoing and easy to get along with. However, it also shows that I am an easily infected person, sometimes softhearted and do not know how to reject others. This is somewhat similar to me in reality, and sometimes I want to be more decisive.In terms of the result of learning style test,Visual learning is my main way of learning. I think in the future, I can use more ways of watching pictures to assist my learning.Kinesthetic learning is not my main learning method. Learning by doing will affect my learning efficiency.The results of the Big Five personality test show that my personality is suitable for helping others in daily and practical ways, and I will work hard in this aspect in the future.</p>
                    <p>②I feel that my friendly and outgoing personality can help me quickly establish friendship and cooperation with other people in the team, and I can use the learning method that suits me to play an appropriate role in team work and share experience with my teammates.In the team, I will try to work in a practical way to be responsible for our teamwork.However,Sometimes I do not know how to reject a person's requirement, which can also bring hidden dangers to teamwork. For example, sometimes I do not deny bad ideas from other people in the team.Moreover,my lack of learning by doing may also lead to mistakes in the actual operation of some teamwork.</p>
                    <p>③When forming a team, I will try my best to find people who are good at hands-on operations to make up for my shortcomings in this area. Also for me, finding creative people as teammates is also a good choice.However, in terms of personality, I expect to form a team with a group of equally friendly and outgoing people, which will create a relaxed working atmosphere.</p>

                     <h2 class="major">Project idea</h2>
                    <p> Dog communication robot</p>
                    <p> Animals are an indispensable part of natural society, for humans, dogs are a special presence in daily life. As the most loyal partner of humans, dogs can always accurately capture the various signals released by humans. In order to get along better with the dog, overcoming the communication barriers between dogs and humans is a major issue worth breaking through. For this goal, our project aims to realize the communication between intelligent robots and dogs. By shaping the dog appearance of the robot and recording the sounds of different dogs, we can understand the dog's thoughts and learn more from their habits to get along better with them as much as possible. The key technology of this project is to analyze the frequencies and sizes of sounds produced by different dogs and explore the meaning of them.</p>
                    <p>According to Sundra Chelsea Atitwa(2018), there are more than 73 million dogs and over 42.5 million households have one or more dogs in United States. This is enough to prove that a number of people love dogs and treat them as one of their life partners. Dogs could not speak, but as friends, owners look forward to communicating with their dogs. The robot dog can receive dog language and convert it into human language, so that it can achieve barrier-free communication between dogs and humans. People can fully understand the dog's thoughts and give them better care is like having a close partner in real life.</p>
                    <p>For this product, its main body is an intelligent robot. The size of this robot can be various, just like there are many breeds of dogs. The appearance of the robot needs to be processed to look like a dog and their scent bags are to be put on because the dog has a sensitive sense of smell. These are to make the dog feel that they are the same as possible. What’s more, the sound device of this robot is indispensable. Dogs communicate by barking, the sounds of robot dogs should be similar to those of real dogs. Sometimes the barking sound of a dog is loud and takes a long time. The product needs to accurately accept and recognize the dog bark, because there may be various noises in life but the robot dog only needs to accept the dog bark. The most important point for this product is to deal with the language problems of humans and dogs. First of all, the robot dog will enter the languages of different countries and allow people to adjust them according to their preferences. For dog language, it is dog barking. The robot dog needs to record samples of dog barks of different sound sizes and lengths and sort out the corresponding meanings. Developers need to obtain the meaning of different dog barks as much as possible from professional researchers and professional dog owners. This robot dog will sort out the meaning of the dog bark it hears and convert it into the corresponding meaning of human language and then send it out through a sound device. For the words spoken by humans, the robot dog will use the same principle to convert the human speech it hears into the corresponding dog barking and send it out. The robot dog moves through wheels, but its moving speed will not be as fast as the dog because it sometimes causes the robot dog to roll over. When the robot dog hears the barking, it will determine the direction of the sound and move in that direction. Once it detects a dog in its sight, it will recognize the dog's breed and store the dog's information in the memory. For owners, they are allowed to enter information about their pet dog in the robot dog, including looks, name, age, etc. This product will use biometric technology to identify different dogs, just like fingerprint unlocking and facial unlocking of human mobile phones. The looks of many dogs make people unclear, especially dogs of the same breed. The use of biometric technology will avoid inaccurate photo identification. In addition, in order to better make the robot dog accepted by dogs, the appearance of this product can be made according to the needs of different families, organizations, or individuals. However, the problem in this project is the barking recognition technology. After all, humans were not dog, their languages are not the same. Lots of unknown problems may be encountered in language conversion, which may lead to inaccurate language conversion.</p>
                    <p>This project requires an intelligent robot as the main body, which must have basic motion functions. Some other auxiliary hardware devices need to be installed on the robot. First of all, the sound receiving and sending device is indispensable, it is used for communication. Second, there must be a camera system to identify different kinds of dogs. For software, a basic information system is required to store various voice information and dog information.  Moreover, an intelligent system that recognizes the meaning of sounds is the key to the entire robot. Finally, a biometric system is used to identify different kinds of dogs.</p>
                    <p>In order to complete this product, the function of realizing dog barking recognition and meaning conversion must be realized which need to be written. Moreover, the algorithm for visual tracking has to be written, which can be used to identify and track dogs. Developers also need to complete a basic system for storing dog information. The software for barking recognition and conversion is relatively difficult to implement. It needs to be combined with a sound device and finely sort out the differences between different barks. The meaning of barking is unknown, so it will face challenges to implement this algorithm.</p>
                    <p>If this project is successful, it will ideally achieve barrier-free communication between humans and dogs, which will make a huge change in human life. For people who like dogs, they will fully understand what dogs think and get along better with dogs like real friends. A number of dog attacks on humans will also be avoided in life, and lots of people will no longer have fear of dogs. For those social dog protection organizations, the number of stray dogs will drop drastically so they can spend more energy on other things. Dogs will play a different role in human life.</p>
